fsmanifest is a tool for archiving file system metadata and checksums of a
complete filesystem tree, what we here call a "manifest" of a file system tree.
It is meant to be used for backup and forensic purposes.

As much metadata as possible is backed up, but non-portable metadata is omitted
by default. This is configurable through the compile-time define SHOW_ALL_FIELDS
which can be set to 1 to print non-portable metadata like inode numbers, device
number of filesystem root, link counts, directory sizes, etc.
