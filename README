General information
-------------------

fsmanifest is a tool for archiving file system metadata and checksums of a
complete filesystem tree, what we here call a "manifest" of a file system tree.
It is meant to be used for backup and forensic purposes.

As much metadata as possible is backed up, but non-portable metadata is omitted
by default. This is configurable through the compile-time define SHOW_ALL_FIELDS
which can be set to 1 to print non-portable metadata like inode numbers, device
number of filesystem root, link counts, directory sizes, etc.


Building
--------

If you are downloading an offical release tarball, then you only need a few
prerequisites:
- GNU Make
- A C compiler, e.g. gcc or clang
- OpenSSL library headers ('libssl-dev' package in Debian)
- pkg-config / pkgconf (for finding the OpenSSL library headers)

After this you should be able to build the source using the standard:
  ./configure && make
...and install it with
  make install
(this step might require 'sudo' as a prefix to gain the appropriate privileges)


Working with the source
-----------------------

If you are building from the git repository you will need to generate the build
system (which is present by default in the tarball), so you'll need a few other
packages:
- autoconf
- automake
- libtool

After this, you can use './autogen.sh' to regenerate the build files needed to
build the software (see 'Building').
